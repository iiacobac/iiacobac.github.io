Research
======

My current research interests are in dialogue systems and natural language understanding, question answering and commonsense reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic code understanding and generation, and LLMs-based autonomous agents. During my PhD my main field of study was about neural-grounded distributional models, such as word and sense embeddings, and word sense disambiguation.
