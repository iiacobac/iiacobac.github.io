About
======

I am Ignacio Iacobacci, a NLP Expert and a member of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/), currently working at [ELM Europe](https://elmeurope.com/natural-language-processing/). I worked as a Senior Researcher and Team Leader at the London Speech and Language team at [Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/) for six years. 
I received my PhD. in [Computer Science from Sapienza University in Rome (Italy)](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/). I also hold a MSc. in [Computer Science from University of Buenos Aires (Argentina)](https://www.dc.uba.ar/).
I worked on the [YouTube Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en).
My background also include almost 10 years as a software engineer, including 4 years as a machine learning / NLP specialist.

Research
======

My current research interests are in dialogue systems and natural language understanding, question answering and commonsense reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic code understanding and generation, and LLMs-based autonomous agents. During my PhD my main field of study was about neural-grounded distributional models, such as word and sense embeddings, and word sense disambiguation.
